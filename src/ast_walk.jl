"""
Entry point into the code to perform an AST walk.

This function will cause every node in the AST to be visited and a callback invoked on each one.
The callback can record information about nodes it sees through the opaque cbdata parameter.
The callback can also cause the current node to be replaced in the AST by returning a new AST
node.  If the callback doesn't wish to change the node then it returns ASTWALK_RECURSE which causes
AstWalk to recursively process the sub-trees under the current AST node.  If you want to modify the
current AST node and want the sub-trees of that AST node to be processed first then you manually have
to recursively call AstWalk on each one.  There are some cases where you don't want to recursively 
process the sub-trees first and so this recursive process has to be left up to the user.

You generally pass a lambda expression as the first argument although any AST node is acceptable.
The third argument is an object that is opaque to AstWalk but that is passed to every callback.
You can use this object to collect data about the AST as it is walked or to hold information on
how to change the AST as you are walking over it.
The second argument is a callback function.  For each AST node, AstWalk will invoke this callback.
The signature of the callback must be (Any, Any, Int64, Bool, Bool).  The arguments to the callback
are as follows:
    1) The current node of the AST being walked.
    2) The callback data object that you originally passed as the first argument to AstWalk.
    3) Specifies the index of the body's statement that is currently being processed.
    4) True if the current AST node being walked is the root of a top-level statement, false if the AST node is a sub-tree of a top-level statement.
    5) True if the AST node is being read, false if it is being written.
